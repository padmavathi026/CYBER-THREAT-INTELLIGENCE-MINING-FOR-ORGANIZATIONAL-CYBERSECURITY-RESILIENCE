# CYBER-THREAT-INTELLIGENCE-MINING-FOR-ORGANIZATIONAL-CYBERSECURITY-RESILIENCE
<h1>CTI Mining Using Machine Learning and Data Science</h1>

<h2>Description</h2>
Due to the rapid advancement in technology, the severity of cyber attack has also escalated rapidly. To combat the cyber attack we have utilized CTI mining technique. The process of cyber threat intelligence (CTI) mining using machine learning (ML) involves several critical stages. The main aim of our project is to use CTI mining technique to find insights out of the pre existing data and train the machine learning model accordingly to find attacks in the future. 

Initially, data is collected from various sources such as network logs, endpoint devices, and threat intelligence feeds. This data undergoes preprocessing to standardize formats and clean noise, ensuring quality inputs for analysis.

Next, ML techniques like KNN (K-Nearest Neighbors), Random Forest, and Logistic Regression were applied. These Supervised learning models are trained on labeled datasets to classify and predict threats based on historical patterns, where we achieved the accuracy of 99.99% using Random Forest model, 97% accuracy with KNN model . 

The pre-existing applications can only detect if the attack has happened or not, but our project aims in providing organizations with the type of attacks happened. The attacks include: DOS attack, Phishing attack, Ransomware Attack, SQL Injection attack, Spyware attack and Man in the middle attack.
